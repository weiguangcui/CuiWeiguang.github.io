Astronomy is moving towards a high precision with ultra high resolution of both images and spectra, which will help us to understand the Universe with many more details. Meantime, hydrodynamic simulations are able to resolve dwarf galaxies within a cosmological volume. Therefore, consistently comparing theoretical results with observations will play a key role in the future astronomy studies. Mock images from hydrodynamic simulations is the only way to make consistent comparisons with applying the same analytical tools to mock and real images. The consistent comparison allows us to precisely understand the deficits in simulation and the systematic in observation. I will offer a PhD position (~4 years) working on this interesting research field: providing tools to make multi-wavelength mock images, with my atracci√≥n de talento grant at UAM, Madrid, Spain. 

The student will closely work with me and other experts in the [Department of Theoretical Physics at UAM](https://www.uam.es/ss/Satellite/FisicaTeorica/en/home.htm) to develop/extend/maintain packages for generating mock images which include, but not limited to, for example, this optical image:

this X-ray image:

and this SZ image:

The research environment in the Department is highly vibrant and extensive, from particle physics to exoplanet, galaxy and cosmology. Particular for this position, there are several experts on computational astrophysics in the department which is the host of several simulation projects, such as [the300](https://the300-project.org), [UNIT](http://www.unitsims.org), etc.; and involves with many others, such as [multiDark](https://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/mdpl2/), [CLUES](https://www.clues-project.org), [Firstlight](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~ceverino/FirstLight/index.html), etc. The student will also have privilege to use our next-generation SIMBA simulations (currently in development, see this link for the [SIMBA simulation](http://simba.roe.ac.uk/)) and to get involve with any of these aforementioned projects. 

The gross annual salary is about 25000 Euros, subject to up to tax and Social Security deductions (depending on the personal situation of the candidate). Medical insurance under the Spanish National Health Service will be provided for the candidate and, if relevant, will also cover spouse or registered partner and children.

Applicants should submit to the attention of Dr Weiguang Cui ([weiguang.cui@uam.es](mailto:weiguang.cui@uam.es)) a single pdf document with a cover letter, a CV, the names of two people that could provide references when requested and a full transcript and completion certificates including grading scale of your undergraduate (Bachelor or equivalent degree) and graduated (Master) studies. Your cover letter should briefly describe your past and current research interests and why you are interested in joining our group. Your CV should include the experience and skills relevant to this position and the overall marks of your studies.

A Master degree in Physics or related area, such as Maths, Computational Science, etc., is required to be considered for this PhD offer.

Applications received before **August 31st, 2022** will be given full consideration.
