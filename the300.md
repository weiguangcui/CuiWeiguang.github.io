THE THREE HUNDRED project, which has 324 large galaxy clusters modelled with different full-physics hydrodynamical re-simulations and semi-analytical models (SAMs), is aiming to provide a large catalogue of theoretically modelled galaxy clusters for cosmological and astrophysical applications.

These re-simulation regions are selected from the [Multi-Dark Planck 2 simulation](https://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/mdpl2/). It uses [ginnungagap](http://ginnungagapgroup.github.io/ginnungagap/) to reproduce the zoom-in ICs, which have large (15 Mpc/h in radius) high-resolution regions for the clusters located in the centre. Currently, it has Gadget-MUSIC and Gadget-X (more hydro-simulation codes results are coming) run over, along with three SAMs ([Galacticus](https://bitbucket.org/galacticusdev/galacticus/wiki/Home), [SAG](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479....2C) and [SAGE](https://github.com/darrencroton/sage)).


<center><strong>--- A short description of the publications ---</strong></center>
In the introduction paper ([Cui et al. 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.2898C)), we present the data set and study the differences to observations for fundamental galaxy cluster properties and scaling relations. We find that the modelled galaxy clusters are generally in reasonable agreement with observations with respect to baryonic fractions and gas scaling relations at redshift z = 0. However, there are still some (model-dependent) differences, such as central galaxies being too massive, and galaxy colours (g - r) being bluer (about 0.2 dex lower at the peak position) than in observations. The agreement in gas scaling relations down to 10^{13} h^{-1} M_{sun} between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations. We also include - where appropriate - a comparison to three semi-analytical galaxy formation models as applied to the same underlying dark-matter-only simulation. All simulations and derived data products are publicly available.

In the "The Influence of Environment on Simulated Galaxy Properties" paper ([Wang et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018ApJ...868..130W/abstract)), we use galaxy samples from hydrodynamical re-simulations to examine the relationship between galaxy properties (specific star formation rate (sSFR), fraction of star-forming galaxies, g - r color, and overdensity sigma_1) and environments (clusters, cluster vicinity and field regions). We found that overdensity is the primary drive for the changes of the galaxy properties, which is simply because the overdensity is correlated with the galaxy masses; at fixed overdensity, a galaxyâ€™s color is also independent of whether it lives within a cluster or within the field.

In the "The evolution of galaxy cluster density profiles" paper ([Mostoghiu et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018MNRAS.tmp.3145M/abstract)), we only focused on the central cluster sample (or the mass-complete sample, 324 clusters in total) and studied their radial mass density profiles and evolutions. By tracking the progenitors of the clusters at z = 0, we found that their median shape (both gas and total profiles) is already in place by z = 2.5. However, selecting a dynamically relaxed subsample, we observed a shift of the scale radius r_s towards larger values at earlier times. Classifying the whole sample by formation time, this evolution is understood as a result of a two-phase halo mass accretion process. Early-forming clusters - identified as relaxed today - have already entered their slow accretion phase, hence their mass growth occurs mostly at the outskirts. Late-forming clusters - which are still unrelaxed today - are in their fast accretion phase, thus the central region of the clusters is still growing.
