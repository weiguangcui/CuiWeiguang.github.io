THE THREE HUNDRED project, which has 324 large galaxy clusters modelled with different full-physics hydrodynamical re-simulations and semi-analytical models (SAMs), is aiming to provide a large catalogue of theoretically modelled galaxy clusters for cosmological and astrophysical applications.

These re-simulation regions are selected from the [Multi-Dark Planck 2 simulation](https://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/mdpl2/). It uses [ginnungagap](http://ginnungagapgroup.github.io/ginnungagap/) to reproduce the zoom-in ICs, which have large (15 Mpc/h in radius) high-resolution regions for the clusters located in the centre. Currently, it has Gadget-MUSIC and Gadget-X (more hydro-simulation codes results are coming) run over, along with three SAMs ([Galacticus](https://bitbucket.org/galacticusdev/galacticus/wiki/Home), [SAG](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479....2C) and [SAGE](https://github.com/darrencroton/sage)).

In the first paper ([Cui et al. 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.2898C)), we present the data set and study the differences to observations for fundamental galaxy cluster properties and scaling relations. We find that the modelled galaxy clusters are generally in reasonable agreement with observations with respect to baryonic fractions and gas scaling relations at redshift z = 0. However, there are still some (model-dependent) differences, such as central galaxies being too massive, and galaxy colours (g - r) being bluer (about 0.2 dex lower at the peak position) than in observations. The agreement in gas scaling relations down to 10^{13} h^{-1} M_{sun} between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations. We also include - where appropriate - a comparison to three semi-analytical galaxy formation models as applied to the same underlying dark-matter-only simulation. All simulations and derived data products are publicly available.
