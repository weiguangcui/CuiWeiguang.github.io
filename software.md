**PyMSZ** makes both thermal and kinetic mock SZ images from hydrodynamical simulations.
It is also in the final developing phase, you can have a look at the program at: [https://github.com/weiguangcui/pymsz](https://github.com/weiguangcui/pymsz)

**PyMXC** is for mock cluster X-ray spectrum/images. It is still in development.

**Search and Cite** is a web browser extension (currently only support Chrome) dedicated to online Latex writing websites, such as Overleaf. It allows you to directly search these reference papers and (almost) automatically insert the reference text (normally bibtex) into your .bib file. You can directly add this extension through the [Chorme web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/search-and-cite/opadkkneiklbpkpdglojbcgdfaanmkoh?utm_source=ext_app_menu)
