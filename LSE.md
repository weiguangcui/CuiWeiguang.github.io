title: The large-scale environments
subtitle: Investigate the large-scale structure properties and evolutions through cosmological hydro-simulations. Detail the connections between dark matter component with the luminous matters.

With this project, we are going to investigate the properties of these large-scale structures as well as their evolutions through cosmological hydro-simulations. Further, we will detail the connections between dark matter component with the luminous matters.

The first paper has been published:

    [The large-scale environment from cosmological simulations - I. The baryonic cosmic web](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473...68C)

Another two paper focusing on the properties and galaxies are in final preparation.
