With this project, we are going to investigate the properties of these large-scale structures as well as their evolutions through cosmological hydro-simulations. We will present how the baryons are distributed from the theoretical point of view. Further, we will detail the connections between dark matter component with the luminous matters.

The first two papers have been published:

[The large-scale environment from cosmological simulations - I. The baryonic cosmic web](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473...68C)
Using a series of cosmological simulations that includes one dark-matter-only (DM-only) run, one gas cooling-star formation-supernova feedback (CSF) run and one that additionally includes feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we classify the large-scale structures with both a velocity-shear-tensor code (VWEB) and a tidal-tensor code (PWEB). We find that the baryonic processes have almost no impact on large-scale structures - at least not when classified using aforementioned techniques. More importantly, our results confirm that the gas component alone can be used to infer the filamentary structure of the universe practically un-biased, which could be applied to cosmology constraints. In addition, the gas filaments are classified with its velocity (VWEB) and density (PWEB) fields, which can theoretically connect to the radio observations, such as H I surveys. This will help us to bias-freely link the radio observations with dark matter distributions at large scale.

[The large-scale environment from cosmological simulations II: The redshift evolution and distributions of baryons](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2019MNRAS.tmp..557C/abstract)
Following Paper I on the classification of large-scale environments (LSE) at z = 0, we push our analysis to higher redshifts and study the evolution of LSE and the baryon distributions in them. Our aim is to investigate how baryons affect the LSE as a function of redshift. In agreement with Paper I, the baryon models have negligible effect on the LSE over all investigated redshifts. We further validate the conclusion obtained in Paper I, that the gas web is an unbiased tracer of total matter - even better at high redshifts. By separating the gas mainly by temperature, we find that about 40 per cent of gas is in the so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). This fraction of gas mass in the WHIM decreases with redshift, especially from z = 1 (29 per cent) to z = 2.1 (10 per cent). By separating the whole WHIM gas mass into the four large-scale environments (i.e. voids, sheets, filaments, and knots), we find that about half of the WHIM gas is located in filaments. Although the total gas mass in WHIM decreases with redshift, the WHIM mass fractions in the different LSE seem unchanged.

Another two paper focusing on the connections are in final preparation.
